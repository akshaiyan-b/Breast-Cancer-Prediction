# Breast-Cancer-Prediction

Predicting malignant versus benign breast cancer cases:
Predicting the probability that a diagnosed breast cancer case is malignant or benign based on Wisconsin dataset from UCI repository.

Overview Of Project:
No matter a woman's race or ethnicity, breast cancer is the most prevalent type of cancer, according to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (CDC, 2016).
In the United States, 220,000 women receive a breast cancer diagnosis each year (CDC, 2016). Even though we may not be aware of all the risk factors for breast cancer,
research studies on the subject have identified some of them, including family history, age, obesity, alcohol use, and tobacco use (DeSantis, Ma, Bryan, & Jemal, 2014). 
Mammography and other breast imaging techniques have been found to be quite effective in detecting breast cancer in its earliest stages (Ball, 2012). 
Patients may learn about their diagnosis too late if breast image procedures are not used.And with the given data, I have used Random Forest Classfier to train the 
Model which best predictor after tuning parameters in similar research that sought to determine the best way to determine the type of cancer from the data provided to us.
